# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter Jobs in India  

To focus my analysis on the Indian job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in India.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'India']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skill_Demand](2_Skill_Demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in India and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_ind_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles.*

#### Insights

- There is wide variation in pay between roles — Machine Learning Engineers and senior data roles show the largest salary ranges (big boxes and long whiskers), while Software Engineers and Data Analysts have much narrower, more compact distributions.

- Senior roles frequently include high-end outliers — Senior Data Engineer / Senior Data Scientist positions show several high-value outliers, indicating that exceptional experience or niche skills can lead to substantially higher compensation.

- Median pay rises with specialization and seniority — typical (median) salaries for ML Engineers and senior data roles sit clearly above those for Data Analysts and Software Engineers, reflecting higher market value for specialized data work.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analystsr')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](images/Highest_Paid_and_Most_In_Demand_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_india.png)

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.show()

```

#### Results

#### Insights:

- MongoDB stands out with the highest median salary (over $160K) despite appearing in very few job postings, highlighting how niche, high-skill database technologies can command significantly higher compensation for data analysts.

- Widely required skills like SQL and Excel appear on the far right of the chart, showing strong demand in job postings, but their salaries fall below those of more specialized tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Python, which offer a better balance of pay and demand.

- Skills such as Tableau, Power BI, Python, and Azure fall into an “optimal zone”, offering both competitive salaries (around $100K–$110K) and moderate to high demand, making them valuable targets for analysts looking to maximize both employability and earning potential.
### Visualizing Different Techonologies

Let's visualize the different technologies as well in the graph. We'll add color labels based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})

#### Visualize Data

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

# Create a scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_tech_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',  # Color by technology
    palette='bright',  # Use a bright palette for distinct colors
    legend='full'  # Ensure the legend is shown
)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US with Coloring by Technology](images/Most_Optimal_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_US_with_Coloring_by_Technology.png)  
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US with color labels for technology.*

#### Insights:

- Programming skills cluster toward higher salaries, with languages and developer tools (blue points) appearing higher on the pay axis than most other categories — indicating programming expertise tends to boost median pay for data analysts.

- Database skills command top pay but are less common, e.g., MongoDB (brown) sits well above other points in salary despite low prevalence, showing niche database expertise can drive significantly higher compensation.

- Analyst/visualization tools strike the best balance, with skills like Tableau and Power BI being both common in job listings and offering competitive median salaries — making them strong targets for analysts who want demand + good pay.
